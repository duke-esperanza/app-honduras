## Automated Patient Management System

### Client: Clinica Esperanza

#### Purpose:
In Roatan, Honduras the local clinic has many diabetes patients (over 500). This has caused difficulty for the doctors in managing these patients health. Adding to the difficulty is the local view of scheduled doctor visits, as most locals are accustomed to drop-in visits. This has inadvertently caused many patients to miss appointments endangering the progress of their health as well as adding to the costs of the clinic. Our client, Clinica Esperanza, has tasked us with developing an app to allow the more efficient communication and monitoring of patients. Furthermore we found that their current system of updating databases with patient information was tedious and we gave the application the ability to create, modify, and delete appointments. This project acts as an interface to an already existing database with abilities to edit the database as per the user's wish. Additionally there is ample functionality which allows the user to correct and modify previously made changes. This application gives the ability for our client to manage their appointment related information in an easily accessible manor. 

#### Dependencies:
Since this application is built as a website it requires internet access to make proper connections to the Airtable table database. The application requires internet connection since changes to the database are made during the use of the application. In addition, the functionality of the application is ONLY compatible with an Airtable database that has the proper fields outline in the doc/AppMaintenanceDocumentation.md file under Airtable database. These are the two major dependencies for the success of this application. Furthermore the user of the application must host the application on their surge account. The information related to this is also found in the doc/AppMaintenanceDocumentation.md file under the Surge section.

#### Deployment:
As mentioned in the dependencies section the application is deployed through Surge. In order to host the website a Surge account must be created. In order to completely host the application, it is recommended to look at the doc/AppMaintenanceDocumentation.md file under the Surge section for more details. Surge was chosen to host the application because the application is a single page server-less website.
