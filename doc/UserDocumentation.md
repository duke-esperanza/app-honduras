## Schedule Page
![Alt text](../img/main_screen.PNG?raw=true "Title")

 On the schedule page, there are three tabs that you can interact with, Today, Future and Missed.

 The Today tab displays the appointments that are for today. When you click on an appointment, you are given the ability to look at the patient name, appointment time, patient phone number, and two buttons to decide whether or not the patient was at the appointment.

 The Future tab shows all the appointments coming up in the near future. There is currently no search functionality in the Future appointment tab.

 The Missed tab shows who has missed an appointment, and all of the occurrances of these misses. There is currently no search functionality in the missed appointment tab.

 ## Update Page
![Alt text](../img/search.gif?raw=true "Title")


 The Update page allow you to search for appointment so that you can modify them in case there was an error or change in scheduling. You are also able to change the appointment as well. The search does not prohibit you from double booking, nor does it allow you to filter by date.
